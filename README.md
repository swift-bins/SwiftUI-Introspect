# swiftui-introspect (Binary)

Pre-built binary xcframeworks for [swiftui-introspect](https://github.com/siteline/SwiftUI-Introspect).

> ![TIP]
> swift-bins is currently a proof of concept, but you're welcome to use this prebuilt package. It's easy to get started with and easy to detach from later.

## Usage

// After (uses pre-built binaries)
.package(url: "https://github.com/swift-bins/SwiftUI-Introspect", from: "26.0.0")
